The Builder Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to construct complex objects step by step.

The idea behind the builder pattern is that the process of setting up an object is handled by a dedicated Builder type, rather than by the object itself.

This way it separates the construction of an object from its representation, giving you more control and flexibility during the building process.

The pattern is especially useful when working with objects that have many configurable parameters.

✅ Positive aspects
1. Encourages a clear separation between object construction and representation, promoting code maintainability.

2. Provides a flexible and expressive way to construct objects, allowing for different configurations.

3. Supports testability by enabling the creation and testing of various object variations.

❌ Negative aspects
1. Introduces additional code for the builder, potentially increasing the overall complexity, especially for simpler objects.

2. Requires careful handling of optional properties and error management during object construction.
